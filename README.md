# character_recognition_SVM


This project is a naive implementation of SVM to recognize characters from a sample image.\
To run the project get a sample image with characters written on it.\
Run project_test.py on your sample input image to get the output.\
The output shows the top 3 predictions for each characters in the sample input image.\

Note:
 1) You can also run project.py with a magic number of your choice(eg 1(slower) or 5(faster)) and make your own pkl file
   Then run project_test.py\
 2) Do install cv2 and the corresponding dependencies and change the path to dope folder containing the dataset before you run
   project.py
